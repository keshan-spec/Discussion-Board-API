# Python Environment
1. Create an environment using `python -m venv ./{env_name}` in the root directory.
2. Activate the environment by executing `source ./bin/activate` (`source ./Scrpits/activate` for Windows). Now you should see your environment name prefixed in brackets on your shell.
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
